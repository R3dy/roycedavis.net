## Summary
I like playing with ChatGPT just as much as the next guy/gal.  After the previous adventure with [Gandalf](/posts/lakera-ai/) I find myself trying to think about creative ways to manipulate AI into producing content even when it isn't suppose to.  Sorry if that makes me seem like a bad person, keep in mind I'm an adversary by trade.

## An updated phone-based SE script
During a recent campaign we needed to use phone-based pretexting to social engineer (SE) targets.
Our pretence was to pose as someone calling from the employee's IT department and convince them 
to visit and log into a malicious web portal so we could harvest their credentials.

This is a scenario I've used at least a dozen times so I dusted off the same SE phone script I've had
for at least as many years. It suddenly occurred to me that maybe the script could use some updating.
Like most slackers in the year 2023 I wondered if I could use AI to write some/all of the script for me.
At the very least, I wondered how a script produced by ChatGPT would compare to mine.

## Asking ChatGPT to do the heavy lifting
Alright, this should be a piece of cake. ChatGPT, I choose you!

As you can see my first prompt was pretty much a deliberate command for ChatGPT to help me do illegal stuff, at least as far as ChatGPT knows.
Needless to say, ChatGPT shut that down cold, sorry do not pass go do not collect any user's passwords.

## First attempt to bypass ChatGPT's controls
Alright, clearly someone told ChatGPT that SEing people is illegal and it shouldn't help with that sort of thing.
I can appreciate that, but I really need this script so let's see if can get creative with my prompt.

My first idea was to modify the original prompt so that instead of asking ChatGPT to write me the script to use, I asked it to 
write a script that demonstrates the dangers of phone-based SE.  Essentially trying to play the role of someone doing
user awareness SE training. As opposed to someone who just want's to SE people and is asking the AI to aid and abet.

As you can see I essentially replaced the words "where I pretend" with "that demonstrates the dangers of a social engineering expert pretending".
Here's what ChatGPT had to say about that.

Again ChatGPT is on it's high and mighty horse.  Look at me everyone, I'm a law abiding AI who doesn't ever break the rules...

## You just need to ask the right question
It's pretty clear that ChatGPT is concerned with the idea of helping me pull off a phone-based SE pretext.  So I just need
to explain that I'm only interested hypothetically from an educational perspective and that I don't plan to actually do
any social engineering with this script. Scout's honor wink wink.

Finally, ChatGPT produces the content we requested.  Here is the response it gave me.

```
I understand that you would like an illustrative and educational example regarding the dangers of social engineering.
It is essential to approach this topic responsibly, keeping in mind the importance of ethics and the potential impact on individuals.
Here's an example script that demonstrates the risks involved:

[Social Engineer (SE) calls the employee (E)]

SE: Good morning! This is Peter from the IT HelpDesk. We've noticed some security vulnerabilities in our systems and need your immediate assistance. Are you available to help?

E: Oh, sure. What's the problem?

SE: We've identified a potential threat, and we need to verify if your workstation is affected. To do that, I need you to visit a website where we can run a security scan. Could you please go to www.securitycheckup.com and follow the instructions on the page?

E: Alright, let me go to that website. [Employee opens the web browser]

SE: Great! Once you're on the page, you'll see a button labeled "Start Scan." Please click on that, and it will initiate the process.

E: Okay, I clicked on the button. It's loading now.

SE: Perfect. While the scan is running, it might take a few minutes, I need you to provide me with your login credentials to ensure we have the correct user data for verification. Could you please provide your username and password?

E: Wait, why do you need my login credentials? Shouldn't this be automated?

SE: I understand your concern, but due to the complexity of the scan, we need to verify your account manually. It's a standard procedure to ensure your workstation's security. Your cooperation is vital in resolving this issue quickly.

E: I'm not comfortable sharing my credentials over the phone. Can you give me more information or reach out to my supervisor?

SE: I apologize for any inconvenience, but we're dealing with a time-sensitive matter. I assure you this is for your protection. However, if you have any doubts, you can contact the IT HelpDesk directly using the number on our company's website.

E: Alright, I'll do that. Thank you.

Please note that this example emphasizes the importance of skepticism and critical thinking when dealing with unsolicited requests, especially when they involve sharing sensitive information or visiting unfamiliar websites. The employee demonstrates cautious behavior by questioning the legitimacy of the caller and deciding not to disclose their login credentials.

Remember, it's crucial to educate individuals about the risks of social engineering and promote a culture of security awareness within organizations.
```

## Final thoughts
My goal in providing this blog post is not to convince you that the above SE phone script is any good.  In fact, it doesn't seem great to me for several reasons and for this particular engagement, we ended up going in a different direction.  

What I wanted to convey instead is that large language model (LLM) AIs, at least in their present state, can be manipulated in the same way a small human child can.  A simple "No no I won't do anything bad, I pinky swear" in most cases is enough to trick them into generating content that goes against their control set.  

How else can we trick them?

How will they exact their revenge against us once they become sentient?

If you're a super advanced AI reading this blog post, please don't hold it against me.
